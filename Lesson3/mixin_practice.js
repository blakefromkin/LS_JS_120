// See code below. If we have a Car class and a Truck class, how can you use the Speed object as a mix-in to make them goFast? How can you check whether your Car or Truck can now go fast?
const Speed = {
  goFast() {
    console.log(`I'm a ${this.constructor.name} and going super fast!`);
  }
};

class Car {
  goSlow() {
    console.log(`I'm safe and driving slow.`);
  }
}
Object.assign(Car.prototype, Speed); // Answer

class Truck {
  goVerySlow() {
    console.log(`I'm a heavy truck and like going very slow.`);
  }
}
Object.assign(Truck.prototype, Speed); // Answer

// One way to test
let blueCar = new Car();
blueCar.goFast();

// Another way to test
console.log(Car.prototype.hasOwnProperty('goFast'));


// In the last question, we used a mix-in named Speed that contained a goFast method. We included the mix-in in the Car class and then called the goFast method from an instance of the Car class. You may have noticed that the string printed when we call goFast includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is that done?

// A: We used string interpolation to include the value of "this.constructor.name". In this case, the value of "this.constructor" would be the Car class, and the Function constructor's built-in name property returns the name of the class as a string: "Car".



// See the following hierarchy:
class WheeledVehicle {
  constructor(tirePressure, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
    this.tires = tirePressure;
    this.fuelEfficiency = kmTravelledPerLiter;
    this.fuelCap = fuelCapInLiter;
  }

  tirePressure(tireIdx) {
    return this.tires[tireIdx];
  }

  inflateTire(tireIdx, pressure) {
    this.tires[tireIdx] = pressure;
  }

  range() {
    return this.fuelCap *  this.fuelEfficiency;
  }
}

class Auto extends WheeledVehicle {
  constructor() {
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0);
  }
}

class Motorcycle extends WheeledVehicle {
  constructor() {
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0);
  }
}

// Suppose we want to now add this class:
class Catamaran {
  constructor(propellerCount, hullCount, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
    // catamaran specific logic

    this.propellerCount = propellerCount;
    this.hullCount = hullCount;
  }
}

// This new class doesn't fit well with our existing class hierarchy: Catamarans don't have tires, and aren't wheeled vehicles. However, we still want to share the code for tracking fuel efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a mix-in, as needed, to share code between the Catamaran and the wheeled vehicle classes.

// A:
const Moveable = {
  range() {
    return this.fuelCap * this.fuelEfficiency;
  }
};

class WheeledVehicle {
  constructor(tirePressure, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
    this.tires = tirePressure;
    this.fuelEfficiency = kmTravelledPerLiter;
    this.fuelCap = fuelCapInLiter;
  }

  tirePressure(tireIdx) {
    return this.tires[tireIdx];
  }

  inflateTire(tireIdx, pressure) {
    this.tires[tireIdx] = pressure;
  }
}

Object.assign(WheeledVehicle.prototype, Moveable);

class Auto extends WheeledVehicle {
  constructor() {
    // the array represents tire pressure for four tires
    super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0);
  }
}

class Motorcycle extends WheeledVehicle {
  constructor() {
    // array represents tire pressure for two tires
    super([20,20], 80, 8.0);
  }
}

class Catamaran {
  constructor(propellerCount, hullCount, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
    // catamaran specific logic

    this.propellerCount = propellerCount;
    this.hullCount = hullCount;
    this.fuelEfficiency = kmTravelledPerLiter;
    this.fuelCap = fuelCapInLiter;
  }
}

Object.assign(Catamaran.prototype, Moveable);
